IPLD Data Model
===============

The IPLD Data model is about data. Data is usually encoded in bytes. Programming languages use types to differentiate between different kinds of byte sequences. They help with interpreting what those bytes are about. They give a meaning. In the IPLD Data Model we therefore have so-called Kinds, which represent an abstraction layer on top of bytes, which then can be translated into corresponding programming language types.

The conversion into programming language types is often straight forward, but not always. Though the goal is that IPLD Data Model Kinds are general enough, so that they can be mapped intuitively to programming language native types.

The Data Model is the layer between the programming language and the serialization which is done by the IPLD Codecs. We aim for having data round-trip between the programming language and the Data Model and between the Data Model and the Codec. These are distinct steps.

Going from programming language to Data Model (and back) is programming language specific. It depends on how a programming language works and which types are implemented. Going from Codec to Date Model is Codec specific. Some Codecs might implement only a subset of the Data Model Kinds or perhaps even a superset.

On the Data Model layer we don't talk about memory layouts or how things should be serialized. We only talk about the properties of the Kinds. How they are implemented is then up to the library. The memory layout and type depends on the programming language, the serialization is the concern of IPLD Codecs. We try to minimize the number of Kinds to the minimum, while still having a useful system, where every Kind has its distinct properties.


Primitive Kinds
---------------

### Null

The `null` Kind has a cardinality of 1.


### Boolean

A boolean is either `true` or `false`. It has a cardinality of 2.


### Integer

A numeric value without fractions. It can be positive or negative.


### Float

A numeric value that represents a fraction.


### Link

A link is an identifier to some content-addressed data. It has the same properties as a CID.


Compound Kinds
--------------

### Byte-Array

A fixed sized sequence of 8-bit bytes. We don't define a primitive `Byte` Kind, that would be redundant as it can be represented as a single element Byte-Array.


### Text

Text is a fixed size sequence of characters. Characters are different from bytes as they have a specific encoding, so that the Text can be interpreted in a meaningful way. For Text without a specified encoding, or if you don't care about the encoding, use `Byte-Arrays` instead. To keep things simple, there is no support for arbitrary encodings, the only valid encoding Unicode.

Just as with `Byte-Array`s, there is no `Character` Kind specified, use `Text` with a single character instead.


Container Kinds
---------------

### Lists

A fixed sized sequence of arbitrary Primitive or Container Kinds.


### Map

A collection of key value pairs. The key is of Kind `Byte-Array`, the values can be of any Kind.

**Q: Why is the `Text` Kind Unicode and not UTF-8?**

**A:** The data model doesn't talk about memory layouts. Your programming language might encode Unicode as UTF-16 (e.g. Java, JavaScript) and that's totally fine. Your Codec then defines how to serialize things, which is then likely UTF-8, but any other encoding would also be possible


**Q: My programming language only supports strings as map keys**

**A:** Depending on your language that might not be a problem. The Data Model talks about Kinds in abstract. This means that a Kind does not necessarily be the same programming language type in all cases.

Let's take JavaScript as an example. For the `Byte-Array` Lind JavaScript will likely use the `Uint8Array` type. Though for map keys it's not ideal. JavaScript will call `toString()` on any type you use as a key. This means that an `Uint8Array` the bytes `0x00, 0x01, 0x02` would be converted to the string `"0,1,2"`. Instead you would convert it to the JavaScript `String` type that can hold arbitrary bytes. So your key would be `"\x00\x01\x02"` instead. So your Map Kind key type would be a JavaScript `String`, although your Byte-Array Kind would be `Uint8Array`.

The same thing can be done in PHP. In Python and Rust you would use the native byte type instead.


**Q: Do floats need to be binary IEEE-754 double precision floats?**

**A:** This is not a Data Model concern, but depends on your programming language and the Coded used. Though most modern programming languages support IEEE-754 floats and Codecs do as well. Practically this means that you usually use binary IEEE-754 double precision floats for your `Float` Kind.


### Binary map keys

**Q: How do path segments work on maps with binary keys**

**A**: The `Map` kind support arbitrary bytes as keys, this means that path segments are of Kind `Byte-Array`.


**Q: What iterators are supposed to do and what kinds they're supposed**

**A**: Nothing special. An iterator is programming language specific and a not a concern of Data Model Kinds. It will have the type the programming language has decided to use for map keys.


**Q: How selectors are supposed to work with this**

**A:** IPLD Selectors can be fully described within the IPLD Data Model. Path segments part of the selector are of `Byte-Array` kind. How to do the actual selection is again a concern of the programming language and its implementation of the selector engine. Taking JavaScript as an example again (as it is kind of special in this regards): the selector engine knows that map keys are encoded as JavaScript strings. Hence it will convert the path segment from a `Uint8Array` (they are as the JavaScript implementation generally converts `Byte-Array` Kinds to `Uint8Array`s) into a JavaScript String and then use that to access the Map.


**Q: How codecs are in practice going to disambiguate these things**

**A:** I don't get the question. What would a Codec need to disambiguate?


**Q: What does DAG-JSON do with non-unicode bytes?**

**A:** This faces the same problem as having Strings containing arbitrary bytes. You would need some kind of escaping mechanism. One obvious one would be using JavaScript-style hexadecimal escapes (`\x??`).


**Q: What does that mean we're going to do with DAG-CBOR  data already in the wild that uses the CBOR string indicator in map keys?**

**A:** This is not a Data Model, but a Codec concern and independent of whether Map keys should be strings or binary. One possible way is to say that CBOR supports arbitrary bytes in *their* string type, so we always encode map keys as CBOR Strings. That's independent of what the programming language does.

If your library implementation doesn't have an intermediate encoding/decoding step to/from the Data Model this might mean an additional mapping step. Let's take Python as an example. There your maps will use the native `Bytes` type for the keys. Those usually encode as CBOR Bytes. Your encoder would then, if it encounters a Map key explicitly store it as a CBOR String.

As we move toward specialized decoders (as we want additional strictness) is it worth doing this additional step in some languages in order to retain backwards compatibility.
